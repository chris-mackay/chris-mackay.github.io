						<h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>
						<h3>Elevate Bio</h3>
						<p>Post Building Fit-out Project - Waltham, MA</p>
						<p>Mechanical design engineer of the offices, laboratory area, and warehouse for the project. 
						   The office is a 26,000-sf open office design with exposed utilities. Careful coordination and
						   layout of the ductwork and piping systems was executed to provide a functional and aesthetically
						   pleasing design. The 16,700-sf laboratory area consisted of viral, immunology, molecular bio, and
						   cell culture labs. The project was modeled and drafted in Revit 2018. Navisworks 2018 was utilized for 
						   coordination between all disciplines.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Moderna Therapeutics</h3>
						<p>Clinical Manufacturing Expansion Project - Norwood, MA</p>
						<p>Mechanical design engineer for the 200,000-sf manufacturing facility. Provided the design and 
						   coordination of the ductwork for the HVAC systems. Also responsible for the drafting and design
						   document production of the HVAC systems for the project. This project consisted of 16 rooftop air handing
						   units for the clinical areas on the first level and 7 rooftop air handling units for the pre-clinical areas on the 
						   second level. The office spaces and cafeteria were served with packaged DX rooftop units. The cooling system consisted 
						   of (2) 700 ton chillers and open-cell cooling towers. This project was designed and modeled in Revit 2015. Navisworks 2015 
						   was utilized for coordination between all disciplines.</p>

						<h3>Ocular Therapeutix</h3>
						<p>Ophthalmic Therapies Development Expansion - Bedford, MA</p>
						<p>The 70,712-sf new location was originally designed primarily as an office space with 
						   labs on the third floor. Converting the office spaces into cleanroom areas required careful 
						   coordination with the existing building design. Served as the mechanical design engineer on this 
						   project and provided the design and coordination of the ductwork and piping for the HVAC systems. 
						   Also responsible for the drafting and design document production of the HVAC systems for the project.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Genzyme</h3>
						<p>MSAT Lab & Office Renovation - Framingham, MA</p>
						<p>Genzyme renovated the second floor at its 45 New York Avenue location. Open office areas will be converted 
						   into lab areas. Future planning for the first floor renovation was also incorporated in this project by providing
						   two future rooftop units. Served as the mechanical design engineer on this project. Provided the design and 
						   coordination of the ductwork and piping for the HVAC systems. Also responsible for the drafting and design 
						   document production of the HVAC systems for the project.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Avecia</h3>
						<p>RNA Manufacturing Facility Expansion - Milford, MA</p>
						<p>Avecia increased its RNA manufacturing capacity with an ambitious eastside expansion of Building 155 
						   at the companyâ€™s Milford, MA campus. Simultaneously, the company expanded the north side of this building 
						   with added office and utility space. DPS provided detailed design and final construction documents for 
						   these efforts. Served as the mechanical design engineer on this project and provided the design and 
						   coordination of the ductwork and piping for the HVAC systems for the eastside and north side expansions. 
						   Also responsible for the drafting and design document production of the HVAC systems for the project.</p>

						<h3>Boston College</h3>
						<p>2000 Commonwealth Avenue Student Housing - Brighton, MA</p>
						<p>Mechanical engineer for the renovation of an existing 224,000 sf 17-story high-rise apartment complex 
						   into a student housing facility. This effort added new mechanical ventilation via four new energy 
						   recovery units located on the roof. All rooftop bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans were removed, 
						   and existing exhaust duct systems were connected to new energy recovery units. The renovation also 
						   required dedicated cooling for the two new student lounges on the 2nd and 17th floors, which was 
						   accomplished with ductless split systems. The building was not originally built to accommodate the 
						   new ventilation duct system so careful coordination between all disciplines was essential to ensure 
						   all goals were successfully achieved.</p>

						<h3>Care New England Cancer Center</h3>
						<p>Cancer Center 3rd Floor Renovation - Providence, RI</p>
						<p>Mechanical engineer for the renovation of this existing 9,000 sf 3rd floor exam and 
						   administration space. This project included the replacement of 6 existing rooftop units 
						   and reconfiguration of ductwork systems to accommodate new space configuration. The renovation 
						   was split into 2 phases with alternate work so careful consideration was needed during design 
						   to ensure areas would not be taken offline during construction.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center</h3>
						<p>West Building, 4th Floor Patient Room Conversion - Lebanon, NH</p>
						<p>Mechanical engineer for the renovation of this existing 2,000 sf space to include 3 new 
						   patient rooms, medication storage room, and nurse station. Existing ductwork and perimeter 
						   heating systems were reconfigured to accommodate new space configuration. New variable air 
						   volume terminal boxes were added to provide appropriate cooling and heating for the new patient rooms.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Rochester School District</h3>
						<p>Elementary School Additions and Renovations - East Rochester, NH</p>
						<p>Mechanical design engineer for the renovation of an existing elementary school. Worked alongside the 
						   project engineer to design the ductwork and piping systems. This project included 35,000 sf of 
						   new addition consisting of classrooms, an art room, music room, computer lab, media center, and 
						   administration spaces. Renovation of the existing 6,700 sf kindergarten building was also included. 
						   The systems implemented within the classrooms were passive chilled beams for cooling and perimeter 
						   linear displacement diffusers for ventilation and heating. The computer lab, media center, and 
						   administration spaces were provided with active chilled beams for cooling and ventilation and perimeter 
						   fin-tube radiation for heating. Systems implemented within the renovated kindergarten building were DX fan 
						   coil units for cooling coupled together with energy recovery ventilators for ventilation.</p>

						<h3>Boston College</h3>
						<p>9 Lake Street Ground Floor Administration Space Renovation - Brighton, MA</p>
						<p>Mechanical engineer for the renovation of this existing 8,000 sf ground floor administration space 
						   consisting of offices, conference rooms, and a library. Existing ductwork systems were reconfigured to 
						   accommodate new space configuration and ventilation requirements.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center</h3>
						<p>Building 2, 5th Floor Birthing Pavilion Renovation - Lebanon, NH</p>
						<p>Mechanical engineer for the renovation of this existing birthing pavilion. This renovation was divided 
						   into 3 phases spread over various areas totaling 5,800 sf. The project added 2 new birthing spaces, 
						   new tub room, and new triage space; it also refinished 3 existing birthing spaces.</p>
